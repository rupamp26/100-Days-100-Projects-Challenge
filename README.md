# ðŸš€ 100 Days, 100 Projects: Web3, Blockchain, Backend, and AI/ML

Welcome to my **100 Days, 100 Projects** challenge!

## What is this?
For the next 100 days, Iâ€™m building **one project every single day** across the bleeding edge of technology:  
- Web3 & Blockchain  
- DeFi & NFTs  
- Backend Engineering  
- AI & Machine Learning  
- Metaverse & Advanced Computer Science

## Why?
I believe in learning by doingâ€”and pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible. This journey is about mastering new stacks, shipping real products, and sharing everything I learn with the world.

## What to expect:
- **Daily commits**: Each day, a new repo/project will appear here.
- **Full transparency**: Code, docs, and demosâ€”open for all.
- **Tech stack variety**: Solidity, Rust, React, Node, Python, TensorFlow, and more.
- **Ambitious ideas**: From cross-chain DeFi bots to decentralised AI marketplaces.
